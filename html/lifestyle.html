          <h1>A surfer's lifestyle...</h1>
          <p><strong>Though the iconic illustration of a surfer is one of a peaceful individual living a simple life, the reality often requires some sacrifices and a lifestyle quite removed from that as viewed by non-surfers.</strong>
                <br /><br />
                Actually, living a surfer's lifestyle is not about how exactly you appear; the things you wear or simply getting a surfboard tucked under your arm. It is just about a mindset, commitment to the ocean and accepting the fact that almost everything needs to take second place the instant the waves start to roll in.
                <br /><br />
                People who have fully committed themselves to surfing usually tend to do this in one of two ways - by relocating to the ocean and surfing at a devoted break day in and day out or by giving up the usual trappings of life and traveling the entire world in a continuous search for the perfect wave.
                <br /><br />

                <br /><br />
                <i>Either way, most people will likely find themselves having to live frugally with the intention to achieve their goal and, for a nomadic surfer, will have to accept living without most of the luxuries and benefits that are regarded as the norm.</i>
                <br /><br />
                This also includes relationships, possessions and all other things which are generally used to indicate security and stability.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>The modern surfer is also a citizen of the world. He/she needs to know before he goes. Therefore, if you want to live the ultimate surfing life, tick the following boxes:</strong> 
                <br /><br />
                <strong>1. Know the ocean:</strong> learn what the wind is, and how it affects the ocean before it starts making waves;
                <br /><br />
                <strong>2. Eat well:</strong> fast food is surfing's worst enemy. Design your own diet, and include fruits in your daily habits;
                <br /><br />
                <strong>3. Exercise your body:</strong> ask a professional to delineate a surf training program that can fit into your weekly agenda;
                <br /><br />

                <br /><br />
                <strong>4. Study the weather charts:</strong> improve your surf forecasting knowledge, and anticipate the best swells;
                <br /><br />
                <strong>5. Read surf books:</strong> it might sound strange, but surf literature will make you a better surfer;
                <br /><br />
                <strong>6. Surf more:</strong> establish a surfing routine, and don't let winter stop you from catching waves;
                <br /><br />
                <strong>7. Don't follow the flock:</strong> surfers tend to surf where other surfers are surfing - watch the waves, and make your assessment;
                <br /><br />

                <br /><br />
                <strong>8. Travel and search new waves:</strong> plan a surf trip, build your own hierarchy of surf spots, and establish a personal wave quality scale;
                <br /><br />
                <strong>9. Respect others:</strong> surfers think surfing is a spiritual, blessed sport, but they can be greedy and voracious when it comes to catching waves - showing respect is teaching respect;
                <br /><br />
                <strong>10. Stay true to yourself:</strong> don't imitate, don't mimic - just let your mind and soul tell you what to do in the waves;</p>
